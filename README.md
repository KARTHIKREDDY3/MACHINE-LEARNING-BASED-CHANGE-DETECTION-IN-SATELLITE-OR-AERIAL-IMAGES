# MACHINE-LEARNING-BASED-CHANGE-DETECTION-IN-SATELLITE-OR-AERIAL-IMAGES
To obtain the change detection between two images taken in different time instances at same geographical area.
This change detection can be obtained by using python or matlab.
And i am uploading both simulation codes
use any gray scale images which is taken at different time instances at same geographical area. 

NOTE: cd.py and changedetection.py are both different but gives good results. for good image resolution use changedetection.py. for good understanding and clarity use cd.py
